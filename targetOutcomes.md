For this article you should focus on the findings reported in section 3.2. Dot Discrimination task: First order performance. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> We compared the bilinguals’ and monolinguals’ performance with regard to their first order accuracy (measured by percentage of correct responses), the difficulty of the trials (measured by dot difference) and response time of the choice and the confidence judgment (both measured in seconds). The results of all these analyses are summarised in Table 3.
